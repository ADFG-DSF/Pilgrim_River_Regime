Pilgrim_River_Regime

A regime transition model based on an analysis Curry Cunningham prepared for Bristol Bay sockeye. This application is data limited and was done to see if it would fit a 17 year dataset when used with informative priors. The ADF&G network location for this repository is S:\RTS\Reimer\Pilgrim_sockeye.

data: Pilgrim...csv is the raw data recived from AYK staff. brood_table.xlsx is a brood table I created to read into jags.
quarto: quarto and html files shared with AYK staff.
scripts: script I used to develop the model.
